/**
 * ðŸ”¢ Leetcode 162 - Find Peak Element
 * 
 * ðŸ“˜ Problem Description:
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * Given an input array `nums`, find a peak element and return its index.
 * Assume that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž, and there is always at least one peak.
 * The algorithm must run in O(log n) time complexity.

var findPeakElement = function(nums) {
    // Initialize the search space with left at start and right at end of array
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
  
    // Continue binary search while the search space has more than one element
    while (left < right) {
      // Calculate the middle index of the current search space
      let mid = Math.floor(left + ((right - left) / 2));
