 * ðŸ”¢ LeetCode 153 â€“ Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
 * 
 * ðŸ§  Binary search is used to find the pivot point where rotation happened.
 * The minimum element is the only element smaller than the one before it.
 * Because array is rotated and sorted, we compare with right end to decide direction.
